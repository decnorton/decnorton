<h1 class="page-title">My name is Declan Norton; I’m a 20-year-old Web Developer and Designer.</h1>
<p>I'm currently an undergraduate studying BSc Digital Art and Technology at the University of Plymouth. I have a very strong sense of ethics and best practice and I love doing stuff properly.</p>
<p>I’ve been actively involved in creating web-based content for around four years, having started teaching myself how to code after leaving school. I’ve been lucky enough to have been employed by MAS Design (a small IT services based company) since January 2011. Whilst working with MAS I’ve had the opportunity to create a number of bespoke websites and applications using exciting new technologies such as augmented reality and Smart TV convergence.</p>
