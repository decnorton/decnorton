<p>This was supposed to be a crowd sourcing project, but I suppose our group jumped the gun a bit when we were shown <a title="sweding" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Kind_Rewind#.22Sweded.22" target="_blank">'sweding'</a>. We just wanted to have a laugh.</p>
<p>We set out with a rough plan, giddy at the thought of Andy in a jockstrap being on YouTube for everyone to see. We'd managed to get the majority of filming done before the next session, where we were shown sites/projects such as the <a title="Johnny Cash Project" href="http://www.thejohnnycashproject.com/" target="_blank">Johnny Cash Project</a>. A lot of other groups decided to base there's on the same concept, posting messages and events on Facebook to try and get people involved.</p>
<p>It was too late to try and change our game plan so we stuck with it and filmed a few more scenes. You can see the result below:</p>

<p>It's not exactly viral, but it's got close to 100 views! Though I've got a feeling Andy may be the majority, checking himself out.</p>
