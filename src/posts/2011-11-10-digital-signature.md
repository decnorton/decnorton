<p>I chose the font Helvetica as it's widely regarded the most legible of typefaces, and is generally nice looking.</p>
<p>Didn't realise we were allowed to use colour, so I used a cutout effect to make it a bit more interesting to look at. Chose to make it all lower-case as it's informal and approachable.</p>
