In October we had to prepare a pitch that should last no more than two minutes. It should tell a story and convey a problem and solution.

You can see the video of my pitch below.

After having seen the video, I can see my presentation skills need a bit of work! I noticed I tend to use a lot of filler words (like, um etc.) and throw my hands around a lot. I'll attribute this to nerves and unpreparedness, but there's definitely room for improvement.
