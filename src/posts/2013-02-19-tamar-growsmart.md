<p>As part of our Creative Industries module, we were required to liaise with and create a product or solution for <a href="http://tamargrowlocal.org">Tamar Grow Local</a>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Our group came up with a few ideas, but eventually settled on the idea of creating an app to encourage people to start home-growing their fruit and vegetables. <abbr title="Tamar Grow Local">TGL</abbr> have already produced a <a href="http://www.tamargrowlocal.org/files/vegetable-planting-planner.pdf">vegetable planting guide</a>, but it's served as a PDF and is quite complex to read. We wanted to use the information already available from this guide and add an interactive layer to it.</p>
<p>Our concept was this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow users to create a virtual garden containing all of the fruit and veg that they're growing.</li>
<li>Show users information relevant to planting the garden, such as tips and tricks.</li>
<li>Push Notifications to let the user know when you need to perform a certain action.</li>
<li>Local Allotment finder. A map showing the locations of Allotments managed by Tamar Grow Local</li>
<li>Local Produce finder. A mirror of the food map available on the <abbr title="Tamar Grow Local">TGL</abbr> website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Initially the app will be developed for Android only as that's the only platform we have experience with.</p>
