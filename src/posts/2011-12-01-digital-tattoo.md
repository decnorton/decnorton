<p>With this task, I wanted to keep it relatively simple and concentrate on making it look like an actual tattoo. Whereas other have filled the entire area with text, I chose to include just a few words.</p>
<p>It's definitely not the best photoshopped tattoo but it's not too bad considering the brief and the time in which I did it.</p>
