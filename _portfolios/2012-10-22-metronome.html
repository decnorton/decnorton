<p>An HTML5 experiment using the new WebAudio API.<br />
<!--more--><br />
Being a drummer, this came out of the necessity to practise whilst away from my kit. I didn't fancy spending what little money I had on a real metronome so I went about looking for free online metronomes. All the ones I found were plastered in ads and rather outdated, so I set about building my own using modern technologies!</p>
