<p>Once we had the data in place and ready to be used, I started work on the Android development using the Android Developer Tools. I learnt a few new things on this project, including filtering <code>ListView</code>s and dealing with <code>DialogFragments</code>.</p>

<p>The app uses the Google Maps Android API v2 for the Allotments and Producers views. The new API makes it incredibly easy to add and remove markers, and set InfoWindow adapters. One nuisance was that the only data you can attach to a Marker are the "Title" or the "Snippet", not very handy if your dataset relies on IDs.</p>
