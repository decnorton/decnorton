<p>Flat mates are burning fish fingers again; what should I try and save this time?</p>

<ul>
<li>Phone - First and foremost. I think we'd all be lost without one!</li>
<li>Wallet</li>
<li>Blue Folder - a folder containing mementos from different places I've been, including a rather large collection of beer labels!</li>
<li>External Hard-Drive</li>
<li>Laptop</li>
</ul>
<p>While phone, wallet and laptop can easily be replaced, but the mementos I have stored in the folder and on my hard-drive are irreplaceable to me. I would never be able to get those back.</p>
