In December we presented a longer pitch to the group and three external entrepreneurs. This pitch was to be no longer than 5 minutes and include a bit more about the company structure.

Comparing this to my two minute presentation I still have a problem with filler words and hand movements, but it seems better. I had spent more time practising this pitch but was still half relying on the fact I'd have my notes, which in the end didn't show on my screen. There are noticeable pauses when I recall points and overall the pitch came in under time due to missing bits.

I started off by giving some background about myself, not to be conceited, but to give the audience some knowledge of where the idea came from and to hopefully bolster it's viability in their eyes.
