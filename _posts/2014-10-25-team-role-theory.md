In our first Venture Culture session we were asked to complete a couple of questionnaires to help us determine how we would fit into a team.

<!--more-->

One of these was to determine our [Belbin Team Role](http://www.belbin.com/rte.asp?id=8), and the other was a [Multiple Intelligence Test](http://infed.org/mobi/howard-gardner-multiple-intelligences-and-education/) which is based on Howard Gardners MI Model.

## Results

### Belbin - ([pdf](/assets/belbin_questionnaire.pdf))
According to the Belbin Questionnaire I'm a tied Chair Persion and Company Worker, with Completer Finisher coming a close second. I think this is quite accurate as I often fall into an organisational/leadership role, but I'm also not afraid get stuck in either.

### Multiple Intelligences - ([pdf](/assets/multiple_intelligences_test.pdf))
The MI test gave me a top score for Musical, with Bodily-Kinesthetic and Interpersonal tied second. I also found this quite accurate, I'm a very musical person; I always work with music in the background and I've been involved in bands since I was 13.
