<p>Just putting the finishing touches on my one page website, thought I'd write a post about the kind of process I went through in designing and making it.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I've been doing stuff like this for a few years now so I've got a bit of a head-start on most, though that's not to say everything is perfect.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>First of all, I had to come up with a design, or at least a theme. I wasn't very imaginative with this, you can probably find hundreds of similar concepts - notes/pages stuck up with tape. It's quite aesthetically pleasing as it brings physical objects into a digital environment and it looks different to a standard website. I created a basic layout on paper so I had a rough idea of what I wanted it to look like.</p>
<figure><img class="size-medium wp-image-80 " style="border-color:initial;border-style:initial;" title="Photoshop" src="/assets/screen-shot-2011-10-16-at-20-46-13.png?w=300" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Next I created a mockup, which I did in Photoshop.Â It's important to get the dimensions right in your mockup, it makes thing a whole lot easier later on when you're putting it all together. Of course you don't need to do it in Photoshop at all, you can do it with a pen and paper or even in Microsoft Paint if it tickles your fancy. I use Photoshop as it allows me to create a pixel for pixel reference. I can grab elements and put them into a webpage in seconds.</p>
<p>To get the background I spent a little while searching the google for a texture I liked. Came across this by someone who goes by the name of 'bittbox'.</p>

<p>He'd released it under the Creative Commons license and allowed people to remix it and use it for commercial purposes. Played about with it in Photoshop (woo!) to make it a bit lighter.</p>
<p>Next I used an article I had come across to create a background tile out of it.</p>
<p><a href="http://designfestival.com/creating-seamless-textures-without-even-leaving-your-browser/" target="_blank">Creating Seamless Textures Without Even Leaving Your Browser</a></p>
<p>By this point I had everything I needed to start coding the site. I had my finalised design, I had my background tile and I had my brain.</p>
<p>I started by thinking about what kind of containers I would need to house the content. The HTML ended up looking something like this:</p>
<figure>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-72" title="layout-code" src="/assets/layout-code1.png" alt="" /><br />
</figure>
<p>Next I start adding the different elements, the sticky tape, the icons etc. and pretty soon I had it finished and had a chance to play around with a bit of CSS!</p>
<p>Things like the shadows, rotation, gradients, fonts etc. are all achieved with CSS.</p>
<p>With the social media icons I used a couple of CSS3 properties to get a funky rollover effect going on. Czech it out!</p>
