Currently an undergraduate studying BSc Digital Art and Technology at the University of Plymouth. I started in 2011 and aim to finish in the summer of 2015.

Iâ€™ve been actively involved in creating web-based content for around six years, having started teaching myself how to program after leaving school. Since then I've been involved in a number of projects, ranging from websites for small businesses to bespoke Digital Media solutions for household brands.

I pride myself in giving any task my full attention, whether that means learning new technologies or applying existing knowledge. Because of this I now have experience with the following:

- PHP
- Laravel
- Java
- Android design & development
- HTML, CSS, SASS & other frontend technologies
- JavaScript (including Node.js)
- AngularJS
- SQL
- Web API design
- Server provisioning and administration
- Scalable server architecture
- Adobe Creative Suite
